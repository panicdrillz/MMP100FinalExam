    <h1>MUSIC PRODUCER SITE MOCKUP</h1>
    <h2>project by Andre Pagano</h2>
    <p>Hello! I professionally go by Niagara Dolls and I am a music producer in Queens, New York. I make electronic pop music and I am still learning everything music theory and composition has to offer. Only recently I have stared to practice synthesis and sound design myself. All in all, I have 4 months of production experience in Fruity Loops (FL) Studio 20. Listen to some of the tunes I have made and let me know what you think. :)</p>
